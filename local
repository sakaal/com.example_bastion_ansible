# file: local
#
# You shouldn't need to edit this file.
#
# The bastion host configuration is applied locally. Bastion hosts need to be
# able to reconfigure themselves independent of administrative client access.
#
# Specifying this local inventory file as a command-line argument to the
# ansible-playbook command sets the inventory_dir variable to point to this
# directory.
#
# Here's an example usage from a parent directory containing both the
# bastion_ansible and com.example_bastion_ansible repositories:
#
# ansible-playbook -vvv bastion_ansible/bastion.yml -i com.example_bastion_ansible/local
#
localhost
